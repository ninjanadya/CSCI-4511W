In Class 16

You are given the following knowledge: "Oscar is an ostrich.  An ostrich is a bird. Ostriches do not fly. Birds have two wings. Birds fly.  Birds are animals."

	1)represent the knowledge in a semantic network.
	
			(Animal)
			   ^
			   |subset of
			   |
		(2)<----(Birds)---->(Fly)
		wings      ^       ability
			   |subset of
			   |
			(Ostrich)---->(Flightless)
			   ^            ability
			   |member of
			   |
			(Oscar)
	
	
	2)write the knowledge in predicate calculus, using reification (as shown in the textbook introduction to Section 12.2).
		Ostrich(x) ∧  x∈ Bird ⇒ x∈ Animal
	
	3)can you write in predicate calculus the rule of inheritance, so the system will be able infer the answer to a question such as "Does Oscar fly"? or "Is Oscar an animal?"
		Ostrich(x) ∧ Flightless(x) ∧ Wings(2) ∧ x∈ Bird ⇒ x∈ Animal
